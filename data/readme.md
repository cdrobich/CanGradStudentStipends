How did we select representative programs?

- Use the most common programs for doctoral award winners from [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/_doc/Students-Etudiants/2021StatsScholarships_e.pdf) (2021 statistics, Table 3), [SSHRC](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/results-resultats/stats-statistiques/index-eng.aspx) (2021-2022 competition results), and CIHR
	- SSHRC:
